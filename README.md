## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Process natural language text using the powerful spaCy library.
- **Code Analysis:** Analyze code snippets for various metrics and patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Train predictive models using scikit-learn.
- **Code Regeneration:** Regenerate code using a dedicated CodeRegenerator module.
- **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement.
- **User Interaction:** Interact with the tool through a user-friendly interface.
- **Security Measures:** Implement security measures for secure operations.
- **Information Retrieval:** Retrieve relevant information based on user queries.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze datasets for insights and trends.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detect anomalies in datasets using advanced algorithms.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build predictive models for classification, regression, and generation.
- **Automatic Knowledge Acquisition:** Automatically acquire knowledge to update the tool's knowledge base.
- **Reasoning and Inference:** Perform logical reasoning and inference tasks.
- **Learning and Adaptation:** Adapt the AI model to changing conditions.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Consider ethical implications in AI development.
- **Security and Privacy:** Implement security and privacy measures.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure maintainability of the codebase.
- **Explainability:** Provide explanations for AI model decisions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adearya69/PusakaOfJava.git
   cd PusakaOfJava
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
   sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
The error you're encountering seems to be related to permission issues while trying to generate metadata for the `spacy` package. This might happen due to insufficient permissions in the temporary directory where the metadata is being generated.

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Use a Virtual Environment:**
   Before installing any packages, make sure you are working within a virtual environment. This helps avoid permission issues related to system-wide package installations.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

2. **Upgrade pip and Setuptools:**
   Ensure that you have the latest versions of `pip` and `setuptools`. You can upgrade them with the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   ```

3. **Retry Installation:**
   After upgrading `pip` and `setuptools`, try reinstalling the package:

   ```bash
   pip install spacy
   ```

   If you are installing other packages along with `spacy`, you can include them in your `requirements.txt` file and install all of them together.

   ```plaintext
   spacy==3.1.3
   # Include other packages as needed
   ```

4. **Check File Permissions:**
   Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to write to the specified temporary directories. If you are working in a shared environment or a system-managed environment, you may need to contact your system administrator.

5. **Temporary Directory Cleanup:**
   Sometimes, issues can arise from temporary files that weren't properly cleaned up. You can try cleaning your temporary directories:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /tmp/pip-modern-metadata-4obtzvk_/
   ```

   After that, retry the installation.

6. **Use a User Directory for pip:**
   If you are still facing issues, you can try installing the package in the user directory:

   ```bash
   pip install --user spacy
   ```

   This installs the package locally for the user, avoiding potential permission problems.

Try these steps, and if the issue persists, you may need to check your system's file and directory permissions or seek assistance from your system administrator.

7. **Install additional NLTK and spaCy resources:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt
   python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## Usage

1. Customize the tool according to your specific use case.
2. Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python3 Jemboute-AI.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts and interact with the tool.

## Check Output Files:

Model checkpoints and other outputs will be saved in the current directory. You can find them in the following formats: .pb, .h5, .pt, .pth, .pkl.
